Hi, Iâ€™m Aneta Coufalova ðŸ‘‹
I am a graduate economist with a focus on international relations. I enjoy working with numbers, finding correlations in data, and creating graphs. 
I would like to shift my career towards the IT sector, specifically in data analysis, in order to leverage my analytical thinking more.ðŸ‘€ IT is a direction in which I am determined to further develop myself, acquire knowledge, and enhance my qualifications.
